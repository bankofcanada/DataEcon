/*

    Dates are used to index into tseries and mvtseries, so they are integers.
    Dates also have a frequency information. The encoding must be such that
    adding 1 gives the next date in the given frequency

    We have several kinds of frequencies
    - no frequency - that should mean an error, but not necessarily, depending on the situation
    - unit frequency - indicates that we're using a regular integer instead of a date
    - calendar frequency - includes daily, weekly and business-daily
    - year-period frequency - monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, yearly
    - custom

    ## Year-period
    The frequency is represented with number of periods per year (ppy)
    A date with year-period frequency contains year and period. The date is
    encoded as year * ppy + period

    ## Calendar
    The daily date is encoded as the number of days since a reference date.
    The encoding for weekly is the daily encoding divided by 7, with
    a the remainder according to the end date of the frequency.
