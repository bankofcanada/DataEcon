    pack a vector of strings into a contiguous memory buffer.

    NOTES:
    * each string in the list must be '\0'-terminated.
    * we use '\0' character to separate the individual strings in the buffer.
    * `bufsize` must not be NULL. On exit it will contain the number of bytes
      in the packed representation.
    * If on entry `*bufsize` < 0, then `buffer` is not accessed, the necessary
      buffer size is calculated and written into `*bufsize`, and we return
      DE_SUCCESS.
    * If on entry 0 <= `*bufsize` < number of bytes needed, `buffer` is not
      accessed, the necessary buffer size is written into `*bufsize`, and
      return error code DE_SHORT_BUF.
    * If on entry `*bufsize` is sufficiently large, write the packed
      representation into `buffer` (must not be NULL) and the number of bytes
      actually used in `*buffer`.
