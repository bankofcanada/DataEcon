# DataEcon

This repository contains the C code for a shared library that is used under the
hood of [TimeSeriesEcon.jl](https://github.com/bankofcanada/TimeSeriesEcon.jl)
for reading and writing time series data in Julia. 

From Julia simply install the TimeSeriesEcon package. 

If not using Julia, the rest of this file should give you some details.
